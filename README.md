# Node.JS Guessing Game

This program was created as one of the self-directed projects from the App Academy Open curriculum. 

The goal is to create a guessing game that is interacting with a user inside that can run on Node.JS.

The requirements for the program are as follow:
- User can select the range from which the program will pick a random number
- the user can setup how many turns/changes they get to guess the number before they lose
- the program will give an indicator/hint (too high/low) to player based on the guessed number
- the game ends once the use has guessed the exact correct number
